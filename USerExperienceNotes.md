## A few notes about User Experience

Design should:

* make it easy to determine actions
* make things visible
* make it easy to evaluate current states
* follow natural mappings between intentions andrequired actions

Design should exploit natural relationships and natural constraints and also operate without instructions.

#### Seven principles for transforming difficult tasks into simple ones

1. Use oth knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head
2. Simplify the structure tasks
3. Make things visible -bridge gulfs of execution and evaluation
4. Get the mappings right
5. Exploit the power of constraints, both natural andartificiacl
6. Design for error
7. When all else fails, standardise.

###The three conceptual models

Operation of devices - be it power generating plant or computer sysyem- is learned more readily and problems tracked down more accutately
and easily, if a user has a good condeptual model.

This requires that the principles of operation be observable, all actions be consistent with conceptual model and visible parts of device reflecting
the current state of device.

The designer must develop conceptual model that is appropriate for user, captures important parts of the operation of device and understandable by the 
user.
