## A few notes about User Experience

Design should:

* make it easy to determine actions
* make things visible
* make it easy to evaluate current states
* follow natural mappings between intentions andrequired actions

Design should exploit natural relationships and natural constraints and also operate without instructions.

#### Seven principles for transforming difficult tasks into simple ones

1. Use oth knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head
2. Simplify the structure tasks
3. Make things visible -bridge gulfs of execution and evaluation
4. Get the mappings right
5. Exploit the power of constraints, both natural andartificiacl
6. Design for error
7. When all else fails, standardise.

###The three conceptual models

Operation of devices - be it power generating plant or computer sysyem- is learned more readily and problems tracked down more accutately
and easily, if a user has a good condeptual model.

This requires that the principles of operation be observable, all actions be consistent with conceptual model and visible parts of device reflecting
the current state of device.

The designer must develop conceptual model that is appropriate for user, captures important parts of the operation of device and understandable by the 
user.

Three aspects of mental models must be distinguished:
* design model- conceptualization in the designer's mind
* user's model- what the user develops to explain operation of system
* system image-physical appearance for operation

##Simplify the structure of tasks

Tasks should be simple in structure, minimizing amount of planning.
Technological aids can show alternative courses of action, help evaluate implications, and portray outcomes in a more complete interpretable manner.

Four technological approaches can be followed:

1. Keep task much the same but provice mental aids- mental aids such as watches,timers,calculators,pocket dicating machines,computer notepads. The idea is, we cannot trust our memory structures to provide essential day-to-dy functioning.
2. Use technology to make visible what would otherwise be invisible improves feedback and ability to keep control-for exapmle a vehicle displays speed,temperature and lets you know what is going on without physical interaction.
3. Automate but keep task much the same-automation can harm as well as help. The task remains the same but parts of it will disappear.Automation of ship and aircraft instruments have been great improvements.
4. Change the nature of the task- when a task is too complex because of a manual skill required, certain technological aids can change the type os skill required by restructuring the task. Technology can help transform deep wide structures into narrower,shallower ones. For example traditional watches required one to learn the mapping of the analogue hands have been replaced by digital watches.

###Don't take away control

Automation has its virtues,but automation is dangerous when it takes too much control from the user.

Over reliance on automated equipment can eliminate a person's ability to function without it

Another problem is a system may not always do things exactly the way you would like.

A person becomes a servant of the system, can no longer be able to control or influence what is happening.

###All tasks have several layers of control.

The lowest level is the details of the operation

The higher levels affect the overall task.In these levels we determine, supervise and control overall structure and goals.

###Make things visible:Bridge the Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation.

Make things visible on execution side of an action so that people know what is possible and how actions should be done.

The system should provide actions that match intentions.Provide indications of system state which should be visible/audible and readily interpretable.

###Get the mappings right
Exploit natural mappings.Make sure a user can determine relationships between:
* intentions and possible actions
* actions and their effects on the system
* actual system state and what is perceivable by sight
* percieved system state and the needs, intentions and expectations of the user.

Natural mappings are the basis of "response cpmpatibility". Its major requirement is that spatial relationship btn positioning of controls and system or objects upon which they operate should be as direct as possible.

###Exploit power of constraints,both natural and artificial

Use constraints so that the user feels as if there is only one possible thing to do.

###Design for error

-Assume any error that can be made will be made.Plan for it.Think of any action by the user. Allow the usr to recover from errors to know what was done and what happened.

-Think of action as a constructive dialog between user and system.

###When all else fails,standardize

When something cant be designed without arbitrary mappings and difficulties, standardise actions,outcomes,layouts,display. Standardize the system andmake related actions work in the same way. The benefit of standardization is that the mechanism is learnedonce.Standardize is essential only when all necessary info cannot be placed in the world or when natural mappings cannot be exploited.
